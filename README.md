# User Management System

Welcome to the User Management System repository! This project provides a simple web-based user management system built using PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MySQL. It allows users to register, login, and manage their accounts.

## Project Files

### 1. index.html

The `index.html` file contains the main HTML structure for the user interface of the User Management System. It includes forms for user registration and login.

### 2. styles.css

The `styles.css` file contains the CSS styles to enhance the visual appearance and layout of the HTML elements in the User Management System. It styles the forms, buttons, and other components of the user interface.

### 3. script.js

The `script.js` file contains JavaScript code to add client-side validation to the registration and login forms. It validates user input and enhances the user experience by providing feedback to users.

### 4. user_management.php

The `user_management.php` file contains the server-side PHP code for handling user registration, login, and database operations. It connects to the MySQL database, performs user authentication, and interacts with the database to store and retrieve user information.

### 5. User Management.sql

The `User Management.sql` file contains the MySQL code to create the necessary database schema for the User Management System. It includes the SQL commands to create the `users` table with columns for user data.

## Getting Started

To run the User Management System locally:

1. Set up a local web server environment (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP).
2. Create a MySQL database and import the `User Management.sql` file to create the required tables.
3. Place all project files in the web server's document root directory.
4. Access the project through a web browser and register/login to manage user accounts.
